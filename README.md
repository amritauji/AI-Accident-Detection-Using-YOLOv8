# AI-Accident-Detection-Using-YOLOv8
An AI-based accident detection system built with YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) that detects road accidents from images and videos in real time. This model was trained on a custom dataset of accident and non-accident images collected and annotated manually to simulate real-world CCTV highway scenarios.
